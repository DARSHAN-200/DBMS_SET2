Problem Statement 6 (Procedures / Functions) 
Employee( emp_id, dept_idemp_name, DoJ, salary, commission,job_title) 
1. Consider the schema given above. Keep the commission column empty initially. Write a Stored Procedure to
 record the employee commission based on following conditions. If salary is more than 10000 then commission
 is 0.4%, if Salary is less than 10000 but experience is more than 10 years then 0.35%, if salary is less than 3000
 then commission is 0.25%. In the remaining cases commission is 0.15%. 
2. Write a PLSQL Function that takes department ID and returns the name of the manager of the department.


1. Stored Procedure to Record Employee Commission
This stored procedure updates the commission column for each employee based on the salary and experience conditions provided.


CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE record_commission IS
BEGIN
    -- Loop through all employees
    FOR emp IN (SELECT emp_id, salary, DoJ FROM Employee) LOOP
        DECLARE
            v_experience NUMBER;
            v_commission_rate NUMBER;
        BEGIN
            -- Calculate the years of experience based on Date of Joining (DoJ)
            v_experience := FLOOR(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, emp.DoJ) / 12);
            
            -- Assign commission rate based on the conditions
            IF emp.salary > 10000 THEN
                v_commission_rate := 0.004;  -- 0.4%
            ELSIF emp.salary < 10000 AND v_experience > 10 THEN
                v_commission_rate := 0.0035;  -- 0.35%
            ELSIF emp.salary < 3000 THEN
                v_commission_rate := 0.0025;  -- 0.25%
            ELSE
                v_commission_rate := 0.0015;  -- 0.15%
            END IF;

            -- Update the commission in the Employee table
            UPDATE Employee
            SET commission = emp.salary * v_commission_rate
            WHERE emp_id = emp.emp_id;
        END;
    END LOOP;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Commission calculation completed for all employees.');
END;


Explanation of the Stored Procedure:
FOR Loop: Iterates through all employees in the Employee table to calculate their commission.
Experience Calculation: The number of years of experience is calculated using the MONTHS_BETWEEN function, dividing by 12 to get years.
Commission Calculation: The procedure assigns a commission rate based on the conditions:
0.4% if salary > 10000
0.35% if salary < 10000 and experience > 10 years
0.25% if salary < 3000
0.15% in all other cases.
Commission Update: Updates the commission column for each employee based on the computed commission rate.



2. PL/SQL Function to Return Manager Name by Department ID
This PL/SQL function returns the manager's name for a given department ID.




CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_department_manager (p_dept_id IN NUMBER) 
RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
    v_manager_name VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN
    -- Query to get the manager's name for the given department
    SELECT emp_name INTO v_manager_name
    FROM Employee
    WHERE dept_id = p_dept_id AND job_title = 'Manager';

    RETURN v_manager_name;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
        RETURN 'No Manager Found';
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RETURN 'Error in fetching manager';
END;




Explanation of the Function:
Function Parameter: The function get_department_manager takes a department ID (p_dept_id) as input.
Query: It performs a SELECT query to fetch the emp_name of the employee who holds the Manager job title in the given department.
Exception Handling:
If no data is found (i.e., no manager exists for that department), the function returns 'No Manager Found'.
If any other error occurs, it returns 'Error in fetching manager'.
