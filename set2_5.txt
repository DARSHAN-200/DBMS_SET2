    date_open DATE,
    Account_type VARCHAR(20),
    Balance DECIMAL(10, 2),

-- Inserting Sample Data into Customer Table
INSERT INTO Customer (CustID, Name, Cust_Address, Phone_no, Age) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'Mumbai', '1234567890', 28),
(2, 'Bob', 'Pune', '2345678901', 42),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Delhi', '3456789012', 35);

-- Inserting Sample Data into Branch Table
INSERT INTO Branch (BranchID, Branch_Name, Address) VALUES
(1, 'Main Branch', 'Mumbai'),
(2, 'City Branch', 'Pune');

-- Inserting Sample Data into Account Table
INSERT INTO Account (Account_no, BranchID, CustID, date_open, Account_type, Balance) VALUES
(1001, 1, 1, '2020-01-10', 'Saving Account', 15000.00),

Step 2: Queries
Query 1: Add the column “Email_Address” to the Customer table.

ALTER TABLE Customer ADD COLUMN Email_Address VARCHAR(50);

Query 2: Change the name of column “Email_Address” to “Email_ID” in the Customer table.

ALTER TABLE Customer CHANGE Email_Address Email_ID VARCHAR(50);

Query 3: Display the customer details with the highest balance in the Account table.

SELECT C.*
FROM Customer C
JOIN Account A ON C.CustID = A.CustID
ORDER BY A.Balance DESC
LIMIT 1;

Query 4: Display the customer details with the lowest balance for account type = “Saving Account”.

SELECT C.*
FROM Customer C
JOIN Account A ON C.CustID = A.CustID
WHERE A.Account_type = 'Saving Account'
ORDER BY A.Balance ASC
LIMIT 1;


Query 5: Display the customer details of customers who live in Pune and have age greater than 35.

SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE Cust_Address = 'Pune' AND Age > 35;

Query 6: Display the Cust_ID, Name, and Age of customers in ascending order of their age.

SELECT CustID, Name, Age
FROM Customer
ORDER BY Age ASC;

Query 7: Display the Name and BranchID of the customer grouped by Account_type.

SELECT C.Name, A.BranchID
FROM Customer C
JOIN Account A ON C.CustID = A.CustID
GROUP BY A.Account_type, C.Name, A.BranchID;
