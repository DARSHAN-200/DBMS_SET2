Problem Statement 21 (Triggers) 
Employee(emp_id, emp_name, salary, designation) 
Salary_Backup(emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, salary_difference) 
Create a Trigger to record salary change of the employee. Whenever salary is updated insert the details in
 Salary_Backup table. 
Create a Trigger that will prevent deleting the employee record having designation as CEO



Step 1: Create the Employee and Salary_Backup Tables

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    designation VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Salary_Backup (
    emp_id INT,
    old_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    new_salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    salary_difference DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES Employee(emp_id)
);


Trigger 1: Record Salary Changes in Salary_Backup
This trigger will activate whenever there’s an update to the salary column in the Employee table. It will log the old_salary, new_salary, and the salary_difference in the Salary_Backup table.

BEGIN
    IF OLD.salary <> NEW.salary THEN
        INSERT INTO Salary_Backup (emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, salary_difference)
        VALUES (OLD.emp_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NEW.salary - OLD.salary);
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;


Trigger 2: Prevent Deletion of Employee with Designation as "CEO"

DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_delete
BEFORE DELETE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF OLD.designation = 'CEO' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' 
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Cannot delete employee with designation CEO';
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;



Explanation
Trigger 1 (after_salary_update): This trigger inserts a new record into the Salary_Backup table every time an employee’s salary is updated. The record includes the employee ID, old salary, new salary, and the difference between the two.

Trigger 2 (before_employee_delete): This trigger prevents deletion of any record where the employee’s designation is "CEO". It raises an error with a custom message.
